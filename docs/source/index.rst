MOVE (**m**\ ulti-\ **o**\ mics **v**\ ariational auto\ **e**\ ncoder) is a
framework for integration of omics and other data modalities (including both
categorial and continuous data). Our approach consists of training an ensemble
of VAE (variational autoencoder) models and performing *in silico* perturbation
experiments to identify associations across the different omics datasets.
